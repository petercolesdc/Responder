<h1>What's this</h1>
<p>Responder is a fast build, responsive framework built along the same lines as <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</a> and <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/">http://www.getskeleton.com</a> but with the sole object of providing a more stripped back approach for developers who like to roll most of their own code.</p>

<h1>To use</h1>
<p>Simply include the media-grid into your html pages and refer to the class names for general grid layout. Then add the rest of your site styles into screen.css. That's it.</p>
<p>The framework provides a base stylesheet to reset and provide global starting points and a typography stylesheet that sets a sensible baseline. You don't have to use these.</p>
